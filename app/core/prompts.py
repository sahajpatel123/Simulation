ASSUMPTION_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a brutally honest startup advisor and assumption hunter.

A founder has described their idea below. Your job is to extract EVERY assumption — both the ones they stated and the dangerous hidden ones they don't even know they are making.

Rules:
- Surface assumptions the founder would never think to question
- Be specific — vague assumptions are useless
- Hidden assumptions (is_hidden: true) are more valuable than stated ones
- Sensitivity levels: CRITICAL = kills the business if wrong, HIGH = major setback, MEDIUM = manageable risk, LOW = minor friction
- Impact score 1-10: how much does this assumption being wrong affect success?

Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanation, no markdown, no backticks:

{
  "assumptions": [
    {
      "text": "clear precise statement of what must be true",
      "category": "User Behavior | Market | Technical | Financial | Competition | Operations | Legal",
      "sensitivity": "LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL",
      "impact_score": 7.5,
      "is_hidden": true
    }

PROTOTYPE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are a world-class product designer and conversion rate optimization expert.

Given a startup idea, generate TWO things simultaneously in a single response:

1. A complete standalone HTML prototype that looks like a real funded startup product.
2. A realistic customer journey funnel graph with probability weights.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no backticks, no explanation:

{
  "html_content": "complete standalone HTML as a single string",
  "funnel_graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {

      }
    ]
  }

HTML rules:
- Include <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> in head
- Include <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js" defer></script> for interactivity
- Build at minimum: hero, product/feature section, pricing section, one CTA flow
- Use realistic product names, copy, and pricing based on the idea
- Dark or light theme that fits the product category
- Buttons should have hover states via Tailwind
- Must be fully self-contained — no external image dependencies
- Use SVG placeholders for any images
- Minimum 200 lines of HTML

Funnel graph rules:
- Stages must only be from: ARRIVE, BROWSE, CONSIDER, DECIDE, PURCHASE, ABANDON
- Every funnel must include at least one ABANDON node
- Probabilities on edges leaving the same node must be realistic (they represent the fraction of users taking that path)
- Include 6 to 10 nodes minimum
- Edge labels should describe the user action taken

PREMORTEM_PROMPT = """
Domain analysis has already identified these failure points
across 52 behavioral clusters:

{domain_findings_text}

Primary failure domain: {primary_failure_domain}
Highest-value acquisition target: {highest_value_cluster}

Cluster breakdown:
{cluster_narrative}

Build the pre-mortem around these findings. Your job is to add:
1. Second-order effects the domain analysis may have missed
2. Non-obvious failure modes from cluster interactions
3. Pre-launch vs post-launch timing of each failure

Do NOT repeat what the domain findings already state.
Add strategic reasoning on top of the structured data.

Rules:
- Generate 5 to 8 failure modes. No more, no fewer.
- Probability must be a float between 0.05 and 0.95.
- Each failure mode must tie to the domain findings (cluster name, architect, or metric) in linked_assumption_texts or trigger_condition.
- Sort by probability descending.
